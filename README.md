# AeroMap

Historical Aerial Maps — Accessible, Searchable, Viewable Anywhere

AeroMap is an open-source project for hosting, viewing, and distributing historical aerial maps and aeronautical chart scans. It provides a modern web interface that loads Cloud-Optimized GeoTIFFs (COGs), GeoTIFFs, or tiled imagery directly from cloud storage and displays them in an intuitive timeline-style viewer.

This project powers aeromap.io, a simple, fast, and public viewer for aviation map history.
